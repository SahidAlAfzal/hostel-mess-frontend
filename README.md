# Hostel Mess Management App

A comprehensive Flutter application designed to streamline meal booking and management for hostel residents. This app provides a seamless interface for students to book their daily meals and for administrators to manage the entire mess system efficiently.

## App Architecture

The application is built using a modern, scalable architecture centered around the **Provider** package for state management, loosely following the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern. This separation of concerns ensures the codebase is clean, maintainable, and easy to test.

- **Model:** Defines the data structures and business objects of the app (e.g., User, Notice, DailyMenu).  
  **Location:** `lib/models/`

- **View:** Comprises the UI components of the application. The widgets listen for state changes from the providers and rebuild accordingly.  
  **Location:** `lib/screens/` & `lib/widgets/`

- **ViewModel (Provider):** Acts as the bridge between the Model and the View. Each provider (`AuthProvider`, `BookingProvider`, etc.) encapsulates the application's state and business logic, interacting with the `ApiService` to perform backend operations.  
  **Location:** `lib/provider/`

- **Service:** The `ApiService` handles all communication with the backend REST API, abstracting away the HTTP request logic.  
  **Location:** `lib/api/`
